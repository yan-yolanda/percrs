In order to realize the dream of \"A World Without Thieves\" made by the ShaGen, they made a self-defeating and unbelievable choice. These two impossibility poses the biggest challenge to the narrative in the film \"A World Without Thieves\". But Feng Xiaogang showed his wisdom in narrative. He not only made all the impossible possible, but also made it logical and thought-provoking. For the credibility of Shagen's stupidness, he even rationalized that ShaGen can get along with pack of wolves, and there are a group of fellow villagers who believe in \"the world is full of thieves\", all of which make the Shagen full of personal temperament; Wang Bo and Wang Li repented. His most important design was Wang Li’s pregnancy. There is no such plot in the original work. Facing the pure and innocent child, Wang Bo finally got together with Wang Li and decided to realize ShaGen's dream of \" A World Without Thieves\". \"A World Without Thieves\" is a great comedy with Feng Xiaogang's style.

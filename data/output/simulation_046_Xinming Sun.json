The world-building and character development, along with Keanu Reeves' performance, make it stand out.\n\n- **Die Hard**: Often considered a classic, \"Die Hard\" features Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who battles terrorists in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Its blend of action, humor, and clever dialogue, along with a charismatic villain played by Alan Rickman, has made it a benchmark for action films.\n\nBoth films have left a significant impact on the genre and are often recommended for their thrilling experiences. If you enjoy action-packed movies, you’ll likely appreciate both!"
